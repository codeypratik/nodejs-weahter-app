# nodejs-weather-app
A simple beginners web app built with Nodejs,Expressjs Ejs and API.
The core foundation of this app is the use of APIs and dealing with them with using Express functionalities to handle the requests to the server.

Explaination:
1. The app gets the weather data of the location, entered in the text-box, from the API used and prints in on the screen.
The API used has a API key. You can use any api you want make sure you have the key to access the data. Do not use my API key as it has daily limitations for the requests.
2. To build this you need to understand how js and nodejs incorporate with each other.

Note: 
1. Make sure you install the necesarry dependencies for the project. To know the dependencies check package.json file.
2. Use nodemon to run your app, it will refresh the server after every change made to the file
